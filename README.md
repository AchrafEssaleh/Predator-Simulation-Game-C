# Predator Simulation Game (C)

This project implements a predator-prey simulation in C. It demonstrates:
- Optimized low-level C programming
- Efficient memory management
- Use of data structures (linked lists, etc.) for simulating an ecosystem
- Simulation of interactions between predators and prey

## Folder Structure
- **/src**: Contains the source code files:
  - `ecosystem_simulation.c`: Main simulation loop
  - `ecosystem_unit_tests.c`: Basic unit tests for ecosystem functionality
  - `ecosystem_random_tests.c`: Tests involving random behavior and file I/O
  - `ecosys.h` and `ecosys.c`: Library functions for ecosystem management
  - `Makefile`: Build instructions (if you have one here)
- (Add other folders if needed)

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Predator-Simulation-Game-C.git
